Hi there!<br>
In this repository, I will share two notes that contains as follows:
1. Basic Linux Commands
1. Writing Linux Scripts
1. AWK & SED

Since I am not an experienced Linux User, I may miss some commands that may very common or important for user experience.<br>
The goal of this repository for people who want to learn or remind the  basic codes for Linux OS experiences.<br>
Advanced Script Techniques will be placed in _Bash Script_ folder since, I thought it will be more suitible in that way.<br>
Hope you all enjoy it!<br>
